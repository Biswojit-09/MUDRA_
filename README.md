Overview

MUDRA is an AI-powered real-time translation system that converts speech and text into Indian Sign Language (ISL) using a 3D animated avatar.

The goal of this project is to reduce communication barriers for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by providing an accessible, automated, and scalable ISL translation solution.

🎯 Problem Statement

Shortage of certified ISL interpreters in India

Lack of accessibility in digital platforms

Communication barriers in education, healthcare, and government services

MUDRA solves this by offering a 24/7 digital sign language interpreter powered by AI and 3D animation.
